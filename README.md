# 🌐 Social Feed – Spring Boot + MongoDB + JWT  

Welcome! 🎉 This project is a **Social Feed application**. Think of it like a *mini-Facebook or Twitter*.  
You can **sign up, log in, create posts, like them, comment on them, and view your profile**.  

It’s built using **Spring Boot (Java)**, **MongoDB** for storing data, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for security.  
That means only logged-in users can do cool stuff like creating posts or liking them.
